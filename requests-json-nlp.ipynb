    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this project, I explore how to interact with web APIs, process JSON responses, and perform sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques in Python. By leveraging tools such as `requests`, `json`, and the `spaCy` library with the `spacytextblob` extension, I demonstrate how to fetch text data—such as song lyrics or poems—from online sources, analyze sentiment, and store results in structured JSON files. This project highlights essential data analytics skills including API interaction, text processing, and writing reusable functions. All work is conducted within a Jupyter Notebook and version-controlled using GitHub, with final outputs exported to HTML to ensure accessibility and reproducibility. <br>\n",

    "Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionalities, making programming more efficient and reducing the need to write code from scratch. These libraries cover a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Some libraries, such as os, sys, math, json, and datetime, come built-in with Python as part of its standard library, providing essential functions for file handling, system operations, mathematical computations, and data serialization. Other popular third-party libraries, like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`, must be installed separately and are widely used in data science and machine learning. The extensive availability of libraries in Python's ecosystem makes it a versatile and powerful programming language for various domains. <br>\n",
